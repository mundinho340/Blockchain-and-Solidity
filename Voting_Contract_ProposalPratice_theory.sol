//Proposal Storage

//In this stage we're going to focus on the storage of new proposals.

//A proposal should take in some calldata, and a target. When the proposal passes the voting stage, the contract will send that calldata to the target. 
//To begin with, the yesCount and noCount should be zero until we record some votes!
//Your Goal: Proposals

  //  Create a public array of type Proposal and call it proposals.
    //Create an external function newProposal which takes two arguments:
      //  An address argument which will be the target address of the proposal. We'll send some calldata to this address.
       // A bytes argument which will be the calldata to eventually send to the smart contract when the proposal is executed.
    //In the newProposal function create a new Proposal with the arguments passed in and the yes/no vote counts are initialized at 0.
   // Add the new Proposal to the proposals array.
