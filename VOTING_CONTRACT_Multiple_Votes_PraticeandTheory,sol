//Multiple Votes

//We need to handle the case where an address votes twice.

//One potential way to handle this is to prevent voters from voting twice. However, what if they want to change their vote?

//Let's allow voters to change their vote. Adding this functionality will require that we account for the vote change in the vote counts. 
//This means that if the address previously voted yes and switched to no, we'll want to decrement the yesCount and increment the noCount. And vice-versa!
//Your Goal: Vote Changing

  //  Modify the castVote function to allow voters to change their vote on a particular proposal.

   // The implementation of this is up to you! You'll need to figure out a new way to track which addresses have already voted on which proposal.
