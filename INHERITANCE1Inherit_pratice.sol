//Your Goal: Make SuperHeroes

//You'll notice that the SuperHeroes.sol file imports the Hero.sol read-only file. Your goal is to create two new contracts that inherit from the base Hero contract.

  //  Create two new contracts Mage and Warrior which inherit both the function and the state variable from the Hero contract.
