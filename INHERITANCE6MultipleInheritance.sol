// Your Goal: Collectible Transferable

//The Collectible contract now also inherits from Transferable, a contract which has not been created yet!

    //Your goal is to create a new contract Transferable that will allow the Collectible to transfer its ownership to another address.
   // In the Transferable contract, create a function called transfer which takes an address for the new owner.
   // Have this function transfer ownership from the current owner to the new owner passed in.
   // Ensure that this function can only be called by the current owner.
