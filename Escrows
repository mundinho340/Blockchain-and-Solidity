Escrow Contract

There are many use cases for Escrows across real estate, charities and marketplaces. It's the bread and butter of Ethereum Smart Contracts as it's quite easy to write, and yet, so powerful.
Let's Get Building

We hope that during this block you'll be thinking about ways that you can use an escrow to launch new decentralized applications. You'll be able to use all the code you wrote in a working web application!

With a bit of creativity you can create something new and amazing. Start brainstorming! 

State Variables

We'll have three parties involved in the Escrow:

    Depositor - The payer of the Escrow, makes the initial deposit that will eventually go to the beneficiary.
    Beneficiary - The receiver of the funds. They will provide some service or good to the depositor before the funds are transferred by the arbiter.
    Arbiter - The approver of the transaction. They alone can move the funds when the goods/services have been provided.

For this first stage, let's create these addresses as public storage variables!
Your Goal: Addresses

Create three public storage variables for the addresses of the depositor, beneficiary and arbiter.
