// Your Goal: Members Mapping

//Create a public mapping called members which maps an address to a bool.
//The bool will indicate whether or not the address is currently a member!
//Create an external function called addMember which takes an address and adds it as a member.
//You can do this by storing true in the data location corresponding to the address in the members mapping.
