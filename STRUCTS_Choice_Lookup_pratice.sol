//Your Goal: Find Vote

    //Create an external, view function hasVoted which takes an address and returns a 
    //bool indicating if the address has cast a vote or not.
  //  Create an external, view function findChoice which takes an address and returns a Choices value
  //indicating the choice on the vote cast by the address. For this function there is no need to worry about the case where a vote was not cast.
