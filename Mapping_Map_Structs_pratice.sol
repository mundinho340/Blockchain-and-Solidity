//Your Goal: User Mapping Tokens

//Let's create a new token where every new user will receive 100 tokens!

   // Create a public mapping called users that will map an address to a User struct.
   // Create an external function called createUser. This function should create a new user and associate it to the msg.sender address in the users mapping.
  //  The balance of the new user should be set to 100 and the isActive boolean should be set to true.

//Contract Security

//Ensure that the createUser function is called with an address that is not associated with an active user. Otherwise, revert the call.
